                <p>This was the result of my first ever congessional app challenge. I loved this game so much because I taught myself how to use sprite lab and months after still edited the game. </p>

                <p>This was my second game made for the congressional app challenge. The game is called Magic Mage, It's a fun simple game to kill time while keeping you entertained and testing your reflexes. It's a game where you play as a wizard who was scrolling through the desert one day and is suddenly being attacked by monsters. You use your magic but they just keep coming. After every 5 you get rid of there's a chance that they use a powerful spell on you that you have to dodge out of the way from. I like this game a lot because it helped me learn more about sprites and I still want to edit it to have more features.</p>
