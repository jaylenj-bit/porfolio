                <p>This is my vision board which represents the future life I want to live. I’ll have my career in track and field or web development. I'll have a condo and other assests that i’ll make money off of but down the line when my career is over i'll likely live in the bush. Throughout the entire course of my life i’ll make money off of stocks and other things I’ll do on the side. </p>
