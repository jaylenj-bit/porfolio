        <p>
            Hello, my name is Jaylen and I am a creator. Now you may think "well a creator can be many things" and you exactly right, I in fact am a 
            creator in the sense that I create everything and anything I possibly can. I love to put things together and learn different ways to do that.
            Whether its through software programming, media, music, art, science, or even something new, I want to learn as much as possible and apply into something 
            people can enjoy. So once again my name is Jaylen and I am a creator. 
        </p>
