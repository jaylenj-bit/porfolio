        <p>
            Hello, my name is Jaylen and I am a creator. Now you may think "well a creator can be many things" and you're exactly right. I in fact am a 
            creator in the sense that I create everything and anything I possibly can. I love to put things together and learn different ways to create things that add light to the world around me.
            Whether its through software programming, media, music, art, science, or even something new, I want to learn as much as possible and apply to something 
            people can enjoy. So once again my name is Jaylen and I am a creator. 
        </p>
